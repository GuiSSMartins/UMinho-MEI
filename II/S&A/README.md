### :pushpin: Sensorization and Environment

***About*** : 
  - The Research Project challenged us to relate the concepts of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Privacy and Data Protection, resulting in a paper "Data Privacy in Ubicomp".
  
  - Group Project **X-Leap**, we designed and implemented an android application using Android Studio. The purpose of the project was to analyse the impact of smartphone use on the quality of sleep. For this, we collected the user's sleep data from the smartwatch (using google fit API) and daily smartphone usage data (through built-in sensors in the android device), this data was then stored (using Firestore Database). After data preprocessing, we were capable of doing some data visualization, which also allowed users to see their sleep statistics, and implement machine learning models. Finally, we extracted conclusions about the investigation conducted and did an analysis of the obtained results.
