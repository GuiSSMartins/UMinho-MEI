### :pushpin: Deep Learning

***About*** : 
  - The research investigation project ... revolved around studying more about Agents and Multi-Agent Systems and writing a paper related to their importance in Industry 4.0.
  
  - The group project consisted in developing and optimising a machine learning model that is capable of predicting brain age using diffusion MRI structural connectivity features. This involved preparing, preprocessing and visualizing the data, defining and exploring deep learning models and architectures, such as MLPs (Multilayer Perceptrons) and CNNs (Convolutional neural networks), training and testing the models and performing a critical analysis and interpretation of the obtained results/predictions.
