### :pushpin: Deep Learning

***About*** : 
  - The research project aimed to deepen our understanding of Deep Learning, more precisely by writing a paper about **Deep Generative Models**. This involved studying the differences between Generative and Discriminative models and analysing specifical Deep Generative Models, such as Autoregressive generative models, Flow-based models, Latent variable models, Energy-based models and Score-based models.
  
  - The group project consisted in **developing and optimising a machine learning model that is capable of predicting brain age using diffusion MRI structural connectivity features**. This involved preparing, preprocessing and visualizing the data, defining and exploring deep learning models and architectures, such as MLPs (Multilayer Perceptrons) and CNNs (Convolutional neural networks), training and testing the models and performing a critical analysis and interpretation of the obtained results/predictions.
