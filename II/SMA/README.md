### :pushpin: Agents and Multi-agent Systems

***About*** : 
  - The research investigation project revolved around studying more about Agents and Multi-Agent Systems and writing a paper related to their importance in Industry 4.0.
  - The Group Project consisted in **implementing a multi-agent system with smart agents**, using JADE (Java Agent Development Framework), **capable of sensing the surrounding ambient and making intelligent decisions by cooperating with its peers in order to eliminate the opposing team.** This work involved creating a visual interface (using JFrame e JPanel, JAVA libraries), defining strategies for the agents (such as explorer mode, attacker mode, and defender mode) and doing benchmarking and performance analysis of the obtained results.

***Final Grade*** : 
  - Research Project : 17 / 20
  - Group Project  : 19 / 20
